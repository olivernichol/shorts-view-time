# shorts-view-time
This project was created as I caught myself addiction looping on social media, and thanks to moving into a working space I had the free time and mentality to think creatively, and as a result I created a timer extension that would record on desktop YouTube how long you had been watching shorts, and how many you had watched. It's exceedingly basic and often stops working, however for being created in a couple hours I'm quite happy with the end result.
